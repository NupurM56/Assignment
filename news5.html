        <h1>Mango Markets Exploiter Eisenberg Arrested in Puerto Rico</h1>

            The investor drained $110 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform. Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose “highly profitable trading strategy” drained DeFi
            trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million, was arrested Monday in Puerto
            Rico, court documents said.
            The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly
            after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his
            role in manipulating a decentralized-finance trading platform.
            Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a
            filing unsealed Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines to prison time.
            A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully and
            knowingly” manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.
            “Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price
            of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other
            manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.”
