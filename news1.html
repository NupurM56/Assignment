        <h1>PayPal enables transfer of digital currencies to external wallets</h1>

            The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its
            platform. After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally
            allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and
            other wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the
            feature expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported
            coins consists of Bitcoin -
            BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58.
            In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout at millions
            of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York
            Department of Financial Services for the conduct. Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of the
            application to start transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID
            verification before the procedure.

            Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their
respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect
users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal
account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming transfers,
The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central
bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of
launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found
evidence of such a stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone app.
